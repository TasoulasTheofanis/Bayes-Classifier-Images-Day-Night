 - # Bayes-Classifier-Images-Day-Night
 - ### This project represents the Pattern Recognition's naive bayes classifier. The code is written on Matlab and it classifies images of day and night.
 - ### Basically the algorithm reads 20 images of day and 20 images of night. It also calculates the mean brightness and the variance of the brightness of each image. Based on that, it classifies the images to classes "day" or "night".
 - ### I will add a video explanation in english.

  ## Based on the project's image:
#### this is the normal distribution, which displays the frequency y of an image, having a x value brightness.

#### this is the 3d graphic distribution, which displays the frequency y of an image, having a x value brightness and z brightness variance.
